# Lean 4 Security Audit

The purpose of this repo was to evaluate the ability of frontier models to perform a nontrivial security audit.

Overall, we concluded that without meaningful harness-engineering, the frontier models are not yet able to find novel vulnerabilities on short to medium time spans (<8 hrs).

This is an anecdotal project, not a large-scale experiment, but it may be useful as a baseline against which to compare more sophistocated attack efforts.

The project is also motivated by the desire to make Lean adversarially robust for FMxAI / GSAI research directions.
